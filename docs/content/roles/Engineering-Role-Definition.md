A Software Security Engineer is a professional who specializes in designing, implementing, and maintaining secure software systems. Their primary responsibility is to ensure that software applications are developed and deployed with the highest level of security and protection against cyber-attacks and data breaches.
Software Security Engineers typically work with software development teams to integrate security measures throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). They collaborate with developers to identify potential security vulnerabilities in software designs and code, and they work to implement controls and countermeasures to mitigate these risks.
