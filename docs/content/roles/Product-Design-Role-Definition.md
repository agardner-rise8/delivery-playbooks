# What it means to be a Designer at Rise 8
The role of designer is critical to the success of Rise8 and our clients. Product Designers help our clients quickly and cheaply de-risk assumptions and invest resources in building products that are more desirable and usable for our clients’ customers. This position is responsible for ensuring that user feedback drives the direction of the products we build. Designers will spend time engaging with end users to understand their needs, pain points and use their feedback to hone in on product direction. Through the use of rapid prototyping and validation techniques, designers help development teams shorten product feedback loops - ultimately reducing the amount of time it takes teams to deliver outcomes.

## What Your Day Could Look Like

### User Research & Synthesis:
  * Create research plans to test the riskiest product assumptions, discover user pains and better understand domain context
  * Conduct research using a variety of research methods such as interviews, surveys, observation, analytics, concept and usability testing
  * Synthesize research to extract deep insights and understand not necessarily what a user says they need, but a holistic understanding of how to solve their pain points
  * Organize research into artifacts that communicate who the user is, their needs, their workflows, and pain points that tell the user’s story
  * Collaborate and communicate across product teams to reduce pain in organization-wide research operations

### Prototype Development, Interface & Interaction Design
  * Choose an appropriate level of fidelity for prototypes to balance uncertainty with quality of feedback
  * Design interfaces and interactions that utilize common, intuitive patterns
  * Work with design systems to create products that align with brand guidelines
