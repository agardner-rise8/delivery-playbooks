# Design Studio

## What is it? 
* A design studio is a workshop that helps uncover many different solutions from different perspectives to a pre-defined problem. It helps align the team on the general user experience a product or service may have. This activity is also known as Crazy 8’s.
  
## Why do it? 

* Encouraging members of the balanced team to participate in the design process allows the team to come up with a larger, more varied set of solutions and evaluate them from different perspectives. 


## When to do it?
* We use design studios early on in the product development process to generate solutions across a wider set of problem areas. Later in the development process, we  use this tool to generate solutions to more specific problems that are uncovered. 


## Who to Involve?
* Balanced team - Designers, PMs, Engineers, Stakeholders, Data Scientists...Any interested party!

## Tools You Might Need
* Whiteboarding tool (Figjam, Miro, etc.) or paper and pens (for in-person activity)
* User journey map or service blueprint
* User personas
* Prioritized problem statements 
* An open mind 

## How to do it (Steps)
1. **Define the problem:** Using artifacts like journey maps, personas, research synthesis, data and problems statements, walk participants through the problem you’ll be focusing on for the session. 
 
2. **Go wide:** Have participants sketch out or jot down 4-8 ideas for what the solution for this problem might be. Once completed- have participants share out their ideas with the team.

3. **Narrow down & refine:** Once everyone has shared their 4-8 rough ideas - allow participants to pick their top 1-2 ideas and draw out more detailed sketches. Once completed - have participants upload their sketches to the board.

4. **Review & Vote:** Have participants talk through their (now more detailed) solutions. Once everyone has a chance to talk through their solutions, give participants 3 votes to pick the solution they think most effectively solves the problem(s) identified in step 1.

5. **Discuss:** Have participants who voted discuss why they voted the way they did. This can also be done with a smaller team (Design/PM/Dev Anchor) if needed.
