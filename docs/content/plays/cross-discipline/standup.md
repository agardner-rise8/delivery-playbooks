# Standup 

![Standup](../../../assets/standup.png) 

## What is it?
Standup is a short (usually 15 minute) meeting that usually happens at the beginning of each work day. Most commonly, each member of the team will share a quick update about what they worked on the day prior, what their plan is for today, and communicate any helps or blockers the rest of the team should be aware of


## Why do it?
Standups are one of the most commonly utilized ceremonies for good reason. They offer a forum for the team to share important context, create structure for each day, and connect team members more closely to one another


## When to do it? 
First thing at the beginning of each day, or at the beginning of the team’s agreed up on core working hours if operating in different time zones


## Who’s involved? 
Product Managers, Product Designers, and Engineers. This should be a full team activity


## Tools You Might Need
  * Sticky notes or whiteboard tool
  * Personal notes


## How to do it (Steps)
1. **Set a consistent time**
    * Agree on a daily standup time that works for the whole team
    * Put a standing meeting on everyone’s calendar

2. **Gather as a team**
    * Meet up in a circle if in person or in a meeting room with cameras on if remote
    * Punctuality is important with standups

3. **Share an update and any helps or blockers**
    * We recommend assigning a rotating weekly facilitator for standups so the team does not stand around waiting for somebody to volunteer to start
    * Keep your update relevant to the rest of the team. It is not necessary to describe your whole day or justify how you spent your time, rather focus on what the rest of the team will benefit from knowing. If your pair has covered your update, it is totally fine (and encouraged) to just say “covered”
    * If you need help with anything your team can assist with, standup is a great time to share it
    * Keep your update timeboxed to 90 seconds! The facilitator should help move things along if people are rambling. A helpful way to manage those situations is to make a sticky note for Parking Lot items

4. **[Optional] Share an icebreaker**
    * Icebreakers are great ways to get to know your team and learn more about one another
    * We recommend the facilitator picks an icebreaker before standup and posts it to the team so people can think about their answer

5. **Pass to the next person** 
    * Standups generally run best when the presenter picks the next person

6. **End as a team**
    * End standup with a clap or a snap. It sounds corny but it’s a helpful way to feel in sync, get a chuckle, and move forward into the day
    * Cover any go-backs or Parking Lot items as you see fit
