# Discovery & Framing (D&F)

## What Is it?
The Discovery and Framing Practice is based on the Double Diamond approach which is a problem solving framework that represents a methodical way of tackling problems and developing solutions. It was developed by the British Design Council in 2005 and is widely used in the fields of design and innovation. The process is visualized as two diamonds, representing a four-stage approach:

### Problem Discovery: 
The first diamond begins with the problem discovery phase, where the aim is to understand the problem or opportunity. This involves open-minded research and exploration, gathering insights, and empathizing with users or customers. 

### Problem Prioritization: 
The second stage is where problems are defined, synthesized and prioritized. The goal here is to identify the core problem or opportunity that needs to be addressed. This phase narrows down the focus to a clear, well-defined problem statement that guides the rest of the process.

### Solution Generation: 
The third stage marks the beginning of the second diamond, starting with the Develop phase. This is where ideas are generated, exploring a wide range of possible solutions to the defined problem.

### Solution Prioritization: 
This stage is where the best solution or solutions identified during the solution generation phase are finalized, prioritized and refined.

## Why Do It?
The Double Diamond approach emphasizes the importance of both divergent and convergent thinking at different stages of the problem solving process. In the problem discovery and solution generation phases, divergent thinking expands the field of exploration to generate a wide range of ideas and possibilities. 
In the problem prioritization and solution prioritization phases, convergent thinking helps narrow down these options to define clear objectives and deliver targeted, effective solutions.


## Whoâ€™s Involved? 
Because the double diamond is a problem solving framework at its core it can be used by anyone, in any role to approach solving a variety of different problems!


## When To Do It?
Anytime you are trying to solve a problem!
