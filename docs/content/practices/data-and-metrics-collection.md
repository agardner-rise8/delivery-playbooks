# Data and Metrics Collection

## What is it?

Data and Metrics Collection is the practice of gathering and analyzing data points from our product or service to understand how it’s being used and the impact it’s having on the organization. This process helps us track progress towards our outcomes, evaluate efficiency and make data driven decisions that support our goals. We focus on metrics that directly reflect our priorities, ensuring they align with both our business objectives and user needs.

Typically, the words data and metrics reflect the collection of quantitative measures so the impact of our solutions can be easily computed and shared.

## Why Is it Important?

Collecting and analyzing data is crucial because it let’s us:

1. Focus on where we’re excelling or falling short.
2. Decide whether to pivot or persevere
3. Drive decisions based on real practical performance.
4. Measure whether our team is meeting business objectives and user goals.
5. Maintain transparency to stakeholders on product performance.

## How do we do it?

* **Selecting Relevant Metrics**: We collaborate closely with stakeholders to choose metrics that best reflect our performance and goals. This can include metrics such as system uptime, deployment frequency, and user satisfaction, with a focus on those that provide actionable insights.
* **Automate Where Possible**: Use tools like Prometheus to automate data collection. This ensures that data is captured accurately and efficiently, minimizing manual input and allowing us to focus on analysis.
* **Continuous Monitoring and Reporting**: Once collected we analyze the data to identify trends, celebrate success, and address gaps. Regular reports are shared with all stakeholders, ensuring everyone is aligned with the data and its implications.
