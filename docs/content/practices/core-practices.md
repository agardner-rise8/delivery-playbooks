title: Rise8 Core Practices

# What is a “Core Practice” at Rise8?
We are defining a Core Practice to be:
> 1. A practice we should strive for on every single Rise8 project. <br>
> 1. A practice every Riser should be able to speak to at a high level.

### Importance of every single Riser being able to speak to every Core Practice
We believe every Riser should be able to speak to every Core Practice at a high level. Why is this important? Rise8 engages with customers to help them transform their software organizations - and these Core Practices should be in place in any healthy software organization. By having knowledge of all Core Practices, even those outside of a discipline's expertise, it allows us to identify gaps and help our customers find opportunities to continually improve their software practices.
> Note that choosing a list we believe every Riser should be able to speak to is subjective and therefore this list will likely evolve over time.
