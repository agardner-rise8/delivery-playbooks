# Version Control System (VCS)

## What is it?
Version Control Systems (VCS) are a category of software tools that help manage and audit changes to application source code over time by tracking any modifications to any files in a given project's repository.

## Why do it?
Version Control allows developers to track and undo changes to source code, and maintains a history of these changes.  They are essential for ensuring that all changes to an application or project are reviewed and accepted by the team and they help developers work together more effectively by providing a central repository for these changes, as well as a way to resolve conflicts between different versions of the code.  This helps teams work together much more effectively and greatly reduces the risk of errors or bugs.

## Whoâ€™s involved? 
Software Developers: responsible for writing, testing, and ensuring that code changes are properly reviewed and approved.

## When to use it? 
Version Control Systems are most effective when used throughout the software development process, and should be implemented and configured before any code is written.  This ensures that the project can be easily managed and audited in perpetuity.
