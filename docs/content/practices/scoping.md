# Scoping

## What is it?

Scoping is a collaborative process that helps define a project's objectives, challenges, and overall scope. A scoping typically manifests in the form of a collaborative workshop which takes place before a new project starts. It involves bringing together key stakeholders to assess the needs and expectations of a project, identify potential risks, and understand technical, operational, and business constraints. This process ensures that everyone is aligned on the project's goals, timeline, and deliverables before moving forward.

The scoping helps build a shared understanding of what the team(s) will need to look like in order to be successful.

Key things a scoping helps define:

* **The Problem/Challenge** - What problem(s) are we trying to solve? What boundaries should be set around the problems the team(s) focus on?
* **Success Criteria** - How will we know if this engagement will be successful? What are the outcomes and impact weâ€™re looking to drive?
* **Team size, shape, and needed competencies** - How many teams are needed to tackle this project? How many people should be on each team? What are the necessary mix of roles and skillsets on each team for the team(s) to be successful?
* **Deployment Path** - How will we deploy our solutions? What is the path to production?
* **Project Timeline** - How long do we expect it to take to hit key milestones? When should teams kickoff? What constraints do we have around timelines or budget?
* **Risks** - What risks exist around this project? What might cause this to fail? How can we mitigate these risks?
* **Fit** - Is this the right project to take on? Can we be successful here?


## Why is it Important?

Scopings are crucial because they establish a shared understanding of the project from the outset. It allows participants to identify  key risks, estimate the level of effort, and determine the resources required for successful delivery.

By addressing these factors early, scopings help prioritize high-value outcomes, avoid surprises, and tailor solutions to meet the customer needs. It sets the stage for a smooth and efficient project kickoff, minimizing misunderstandings and ensuring alignment throughout the engagement.
